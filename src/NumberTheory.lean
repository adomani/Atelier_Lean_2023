The first theorem we want to prove is _Euclid's proof_ of the existence of an infinitude of prime
numbers, following the usual "factorial" proof. As it is "well-known", there exists a proof that is
 _not_ by contradiction. We will need some stuff:
* *min_fac (n)* returns the minimal prime factor of `n`: defined to be `2` for `n=0`.
Almost by definition, one finds the thee following properties:
* *min_fac_pos (n)*: `∀ n : ℕ, 0 < min_fac n`;
* *min_fac_prime (n)*: `∀ n : ℕ, 1 < n → prime (min_fac n)`
  and the
* *min_fac_dvd (n)*: `∀ n : ℕ, min_fac n ∣ n`
Something about the factorial function now:
* *factorial_pos* ` ∀ (n : ℕ), 0 < n!`
* *dvd_factorial* `∀ d n : ℕ, 0 ≠ d → d ≤ n → d ∣ n!` 
* Finally, a basic result concerning divisibility in the natural:
* *dvd_add_iff_right* `∀ d m n : ℕ, d ∣ n → (d ∣ m + n ↔ d ∣ n)`
  Note that the above result is an `iff`: we have seen how to _prove_ such statements, by using
  `split` But how to _use_ them? The point is that, by defition, `P ↔ Q` is the same thing as
  `P → Q ∧ Q → P`, so it is made of _two_ things and we can access the first with `(_).1` (or, for
  those who love latin, by `(_).mp` for _modus ponens_) and the second with `(_).2` (or `(_).mpr`
  for _modus ponens reversed_ - probably `(_).mpv` for _m p versum_` would have been better... ).

And what about the "usual" statement that the set of all prime numbers is _infinite_? Can we "state" 
  such a thing? Yes, but it is _painful_. We will not pursue it here, but it all goes around the
  definition *finset α* (for `α : Type`), that is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`.
  It is implemented as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements:
* *finset (α)* (α : Type*) :=
(val : multiset α)
(nodup : nodup val)
where `multiset α` is the quotient of `list α` by list permutation (in particular, duplicates are
allowed.
* *multiset (α) := quotient (list.is_setoid α)*

All in all, **not very nice** (but the "usual statement" do exist in `mathlib`, we are simply not
proving it today

Now some **algebraic number theory**: we prove that every prime p that is not inert in ℤ[i]
(so, either `p=2` or `pℤ[i]=℘ * ℘'`) is the sum of two squares. The usual proof goes as follows:
1. `p` is still not a unit in `ℤ[i]`, for instance because its norm is not `±1`. 
2. Since `p` is _not_ prime, so not irreducible, there exists a factorization `p = x * y` with
  `x,y : ℤ[i]` neither of which is a unit.
3. Now we compute `N(p)=p^2=N(x)*N(y)`: but the product of two integers can be the square of a prime
  only in two cases: either `N(x)=±1` and `N(y)=± p^2` (or viceversa), or `N(x)=N(y)=± p`. Since
  neither `x` nor `y` is a unit, the first option is excluded, hence `|N(x)|=p`.
4. Expanding the definition, if `x=a+b*i`, then `N(x)=a^2+b^2`, hence (there is no need of an
  absolute value, and) `p=a^2+b^2`. ***QED**

We now prove that every prime `p` that is irreducible in `ℤ[i]` must be congruent to `3 (mod 4)`,
written `p % 4 = 3`. This we do by contradiction, using the above theorem: first, we show how to
_compute decidably_ with the tactic *dec_trivial*: below, `zmod 4` is "the" finite set with `4`
elements seen as `ℤ/4ℤ`. 

**Important note on `≠`* By _definition_, `a ≠ b` means `¬ a = b` hence `a = b → false`.

lemma sum_squares_mod_4 : ∀ a b : zmod 4, a^2 + b^2 ≠ 3 :=
begin
  sorry,
  -- dec_trivial,
end

/- We can then prove the following result, using some trivialities on "reduction modulo `n`":
* *zmod.nat_cast_mod* : `∀ (a n : ℕ), ↑(a % n) = ↑a` which means that `a % n` is congruent to `a`
  `mod n` (the *natural* number `a % n` is the value `≤ n - 1` congruent to `a (mod n)`).
The small `↑` means that we are looking at both terms in `zmod n = ℤ/nℤ`. The fact that this
reduction is a ring homomorphism is expressed by
* *cast_pow* : `∀ (n m : ℕ), ↑(n ^ m) = ↑n ^ m`
* *cast_add* : `∀ (m n : ℕ), ↑(m + n) = ↑m + ↑n`
* *cast_mul* : ` ∀ (m n : ℕ), ↑(m * n) = ↑m * ↑n`
