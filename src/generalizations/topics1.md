##  Tactics

The first main "automation" tactics that you will likely run into are `library_search` and `simp`.

Really, *any* tactic is a form of automation.

Tactics allow us to maintain an abstraction:

*  we humans, think that we are talking about mathematical concepts,
*  the computer has its own internal representation for these same concepts.

Tactics bridge this gap: we do not even need to know what the computer's internal representation is: tactics handle the translation.
