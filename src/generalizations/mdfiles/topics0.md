# Automation

In the context of formalization of mathematics, the computer

* takes on repetitive tasks;
* helps producing more complicated arguments, as it helps separating neatly different parts of the argument;
* informs, ideally, the ***discovery*** of new mathematical results;
* works *very well* to detect unnecessary hypotheses

  > however, the resulting generality is often only useful to simplify *formalization*, rather than *discovery* of mathematics.


Currently, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks and auto-formalizations are not yet really available, though there is lots of interest and steady progress on this front.
