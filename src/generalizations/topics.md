### Automatizations in formalization of mathematics

* Delegate repetitive tasks to the computer
* Help producing more complicated arguments, as they can help separating neatly different parts of the argument
* Ideally, help with the ***discovery*** of new mathematical results
* Currently, it works *very well* to detect unnecessary hypotheses

  > However, the resulting generality is often only useful to simplify *formalization*, rather than *discovery* of mathematics

* Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks and auto-formalizations are not yet really available, though there is lots of interest and steady progress on this front
