{Introduction to Type Theory}

This talk is an extended digression on Type Theory.

As is usually the case, foundations of mathematics have a marginal impact on ``real-world'' mathematics.

This is true also when using Lean

$\ldots$ most of the times!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Set Theory}

Set Theory is a common choice of foundation for mathematics.

This normally comes with

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  a more or less ``primitive'' concept of a {\color{violet}\verb`set`};
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  the {\color{violet}\verb`belongs-to`} relation $\in$ among sets;
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  several rules for constructing new sets from old ones;
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  an empty set.
\end{itemize}

Mathematics is then built on top of these foundations.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Everything is a set}

We practice Set Theory by ensuring that ``everything is a set'':

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  the natural numbers are a set,
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  ordered pairs are a set,
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  the real numbers are a set,
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  functions are a set,
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  sequences are functions (and hence are a set),
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  $\ldots$
\end{itemize}

Everything is a set. Everything. EVERYTHING.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Set Theory -- really?}

I imagine that most mathematicians {\emph{could}} explain how to encode their favourite mathematical concept using only the rules for forming sets out of old sets, starting from the empty set.
\bigskip

I also imagine that most mathematicians would rather {\emph{not}} do that.
\bigskip

Descending inside all the nested sets of sets of sets until we reach the empty set is probably detrimental to developing an intuition about modular forms, or schemes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

We may ``undo'' one nesting or two, but, after that, we probably stop and think about {\color{violet}\verb`structured`} sets.
\bigskip

For instance, if $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is a function, we may think of it as a way of converting an element of the set $A$ to an element of the set $B$.

$\to$ No undoing: a {\color{violet}\verb`structured`} function.
\bigskip

Sometimes, it can be useful to think of the ``graph of $f$'' (which, in Set Theory {\color{violet}\verb`is`} the function).

$\to$ 1 undoing: {\color{violet}\verb`structured`} ordered pairs.
\bigskip

How often have you then used the Kuratowski's encoding of ordered pairs to {\color{violet}\verb`really`} understand $f$?

$\to$ 2 undoings: {\color{violet}\verb`unstructured`} chaos.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Types as structured sets}

From the perspective of Set Theory,
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  a {\color{violet}\verb`Type`} is like a set,
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  its elements are called {\color{violet}\verb`terms`},
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  the {\color{violet}\verb`belong-to`} relation is denoted by {\color{violet}\verb`:`}.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

Thus, if {\color{violet}\verb`t`} is a term of a Type {\color{violet}\verb`T`}, we can write {\color{violet}\verb`t : T`}.
\bigskip

A fundamental axiom is that every term has a unique Type.
\bigskip

Types usually come with rules, called {\color{violet}\verb`constructors`}, for building terms of the given Type.
\bigskip

The constructors endow their Type with some internal {\color{violet}\verb`structure`}.
\bigskip

Let's see the definition of natural numbers in Lean.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\begin{minted}[mathescape, numbersep=5pt, frame=lines, framesep=2mm, fontsize=\small]{Lean}
inductive myℕ
  | zero : myℕ
  | succ : myℕ → myℕ
\end{minted}

\bigskip

The code above defines a Type {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`}.
\bigskip

The Type {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`} contains an element (really, a {\color{violet}\verb`term`}), that we call {\color{violet}\verb`zero`}.
\bigskip

We also postulate the existence of a function {\color{violet}\verb`succ`} from {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`} to {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`}.
\bigskip

Lean's Type Theory takes care of making {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`} ``universal''.
\bigskip

For instance, Lean auto-generates the induction principle.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

In Lean's Type Theory, there is an inbuilt axiom:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-18pt}
\item
  {\emph{every}} term has a {\emph{unique}} Type.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

For instance, the Type {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ`} above contains the term {\color{violet}\verb`zero`} (really, the term is {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ.zero`}).
\bigskip

Imagine that we eventually we define {\color{violet}\verb`myℤ.zero`}.
\bigskip

The two terms {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ.zero : myℕ`} and {\color{violet}\verb`myℤ.zero : myℤ`} are {\emph{different}}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

We can make Lean aware of the unique homomorphism {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ → myℤ`}.
\bigskip

However, we can pretend that {\color{violet}\verb`myℕ.zero`} and {\color{violet}\verb`myℤ.zero`} are ``the same'', only as long as some tactic takes care of converting between the two.
\bigskip

Notice also that in Set Theory, the usual definitions of
$$
  0 \in \mathbb{N} \qquad {\textrm{and}} \qquad 0 \in \mathbb{Z}
$$
yield {\emph{different}} elements.
\bigskip

Even the containment $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is false.
\bigskip

Type Theory simply makes us more aware of these (usually inconsequential) inconsistencies.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why many proof checkers use Type Theory?}

Using a proof checker, ultimately means writing a computer program to verify a mathematical reasoning.

In Set Theory, {\textbf{many}} syntactically correct statements are garbage.

For instance, deciding whether the relations
$$
  \mathbb{N} \in \pi
  \qquad {\textrm{or}} \qquad
  \mathbb{Q}_{\le 0} \subset e
  \qquad {\textrm{or}} \qquad
  \sqrt{2} ^ 2 = \emptyset
$$
hold is ``meaningful''.

In Type Theory, none of the above {\color{violet}\verb`Type-checks`}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

$$
  \mathbb{N} \in \pi
  \qquad {\textrm{or}} \qquad
  \mathbb{Q}_{\le 0} \subset e
  \qquad {\textrm{or}} \qquad
  \sqrt{2} ^ 2 = \emptyset
$$
\bigskip

In the background, Lean is constantly Type-checking every assertion.
\bigskip

This means that it can alert us to the fact that we are writing ``non-sense'' {\emph{before}} a proof-checker based on Set Theory would.
\bigskip

You can think of {\color{violet}\verb`Type-checking`} as {\color{violet}\verb`dimensional-analysis`} in physics:

\]

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Type Theory vs Set Theory}

To me, the most insightful consequence of formalizing mathematics in Type Theory came from focusing on the separation:

 mathematical concept

\begin{frame}[fragile]

Using Set Theory or Type Theory as foundations, has little bearing on the theorems that we can prove.

Sometimes, it may lead us to prefer one approach over another.

In practice, the main difference of Type Theory using Lean vs ``''
